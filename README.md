# Resume-Builder

Here we created the basic HTML structure for our Resume/CV Builder including sections for personal information, education, work experience, skills, and more.

Next, we completed styling using CSS to make it visually appealing. We focussed on responsive design, ensuring that your resume looks great on different devices and screen sizes.

We incorporated JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to this project. We also ensured to dynamically update the resume content based on user input, such as adding or removing sections, updating personal information, and showcasing different skills and experiences.

Additionally, we added features like form validation to ensure that the user provides valid information when building their resume and to generate a downloadable PDF version of the resume using JavaScript libraries or APIs.
